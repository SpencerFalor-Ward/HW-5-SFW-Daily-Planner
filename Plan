Create a day planner that allows user to save events for each hour of the day

app needs to display
    -Time
    -field to hold user input
    -save button
        - clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in localStorage.

At top of the calendar the current day should be displayed

Each hour should be color codded such that the past, present and future are identifiable and it will change depending on the time of day
    - this is where Moment.js comes in

Use moment.js to work with date and time
    concentrate using Momemnt.js in the browser
